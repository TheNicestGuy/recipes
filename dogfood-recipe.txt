Ingredients:
 - 6 cups white rice
 - 8 oz. mixed vegetables, canned (if frozen, thaw in warm water)
 - 8 oz. cooked beans
 - 3 eggs

Directions:
 1. Cook the rice according to its instructions, and allow it to cool.
 2. In a blender, combine vegetables, beans, and eggs.
    a. If the vegetables are canned, do not drain them. Otherwise, add
       a little water to wetten the mixture.
    b. For extra calcium, break up the eggshells a little and toss them
       in too. Or, rinse them thoroughly and save them to cut the
       acidity of your next pot of coffee.
 3. Blend on high speed until completely pureed.
 4. In a large covered casserole, pour the puree over the rice and mix
    completely.
 5. Fill a dog bowl with one serving. Ask your veterinarian for the
    perfect serving size, but a good rule of thumb would be one pound
    per twenty pounds of dog.
 6. Place the bowl on the ground and stand back.
